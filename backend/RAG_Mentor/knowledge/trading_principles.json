      "principle": "Cut your losses short and let your profits run",
      "explanation": "The fundamental rule of trading is to exit losing positions quickly to preserve capital, while allowing winning positions to continue generating profits. This requires discipline to overcome the natural human tendency to hold losers hoping for recovery while selling winners too early to lock in small gains.",

      "examples": [
        "If a stock drops 7-8% from your entry, exit immediately regardless of your opinion",
        "Use trailing stops on winning positions to capture extended moves"
      ]
    },
    {
      "principle": "Never average down on losing positions",
      "explanation": "Adding to a losing position (averaging down) violates proper risk management. It means throwing good money after bad and can turn a small loss into a catastrophic one. If your original thesis was wrong, buying more won't make it right.",
      "author": "Jesse Livermore",
      "category": "position_management",
      "examples": [
        "If you bought at $100 and it drops to $90, don't buy more to 'lower your average'",
        "Instead, accept the loss and wait for the stock to prove itself before re-entering"

    {
      "principle": "The trend is your friend",
      "explanation": "Trade in the direction of the major trend. Fighting the tape (trading against the trend) has low probability of success. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.",
      "author": "Multiple Sources",

      "examples": [
        "In a strong uptrend, focus on buying dips rather than shorting rallies",

    {
      "principle": "Stage Analysis: Only buy stocks in Stage 2 uptrends",
      "explanation": "Mark Minervini's stage analysis identifies four market stages. Stage 1 is accumulation (basing), Stage 2 is markup (uptrend), Stage 3 is distribution (topping), Stage 4 is decline. The highest probability trades occur in Stage 2 when a stock breaks out of a proper base with strong volume.",

    {
      "principle": "Risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade",
      "explanation": "Proper position sizing is critical for long-term survival. By risking only 1-2% per trade, you can withstand a string of losses without depleting your capital. This allows you to stay in the game and profit when favorable conditions return.",

    {
      "principle": "Always use stop losses",
      "explanation": "Every trade must have a predefined stop loss before entry. This is your maximum acceptable loss level. Stop losses protect you from catastrophic losses and force discipline. They should be placed at technically significant levels (below support, below recent swing lows).",
      "author": "Mark Minervini",

    {
      "principle": "High win rate requires strict stock selection",
      "explanation": "To achieve win rates above 60%, you must be extremely selective. This means passing on marginal setups and only trading when multiple factors align: strong trend, proper base, volume confirmation, relative strength, and favorable market environment.",

      "principle": "Diversification is protection against ignorance",
      "explanation": "While diversification reduces unsystematic risk, over-diversification dilutes returns. If you thoroughly understand your positions, concentrated portfolios can generate superior returns. However, this requires deep research and conviction.",
      "author": "Warren Buffett",

      "principle": "Buy the strongest stocks in strong industries",
      "explanation": "Relative strength matters. The strongest stocks in the strongest sectors tend to outperform. Use relative strength indicators to compare individual stocks to their sector and sector to the overall market.",

      "principle": "Eliminate emotion through systematic rules",
      "explanation": "Emotional trading leads to buying high (FOMO) and selling low (panic). Create a rules-based system that defines exactly when you enter, exit, and manage risk. Follow the rules even when emotions scream otherwise.",

      "principle": "Volatility is not risk; permanent loss of capital is risk",
      "explanation": "High volatility doesn't necessarily mean high risk if you understand what you own. True risk is the permanent impairment of capital. Use position sizing to manage volatility, but don't confuse price swings with actual risk.",

      "examples": [

      "principle": "The market discounts everything",
      "explanation": "All known information is already reflected in current prices. Don't waste time trying to trade on publicly available news. By the time you read it, the market has already moved. Focus on price action which reveals what the crowd doesn't yet know.",

      "principle": "Trade small during losing streaks, large during winning streaks",
      "explanation": "Position sizing should vary with your performance. When you're in a drawdown, reduce size to preserve capital. When you're performing well, increase size to maximize returns. This is the opposite of what most traders do emotionally.",

      "principle": "Avoid overtrading: Quality over quantity",
      "explanation": "Each trade has transaction costs and execution risk. High-frequency trading without an edge leads to death by a thousand cuts. Wait for high-probability setups rather than forcing trades. Being in cash is a position.",

      "principle": "Correlation shifts during crises",
      "explanation": "Diversification fails when you need it most. During market crashes, correlations approach 1.0 as everything sells off together. True protection requires uncorrelated assets (gold, treasuries, options) or systematic hedging strategies.",
